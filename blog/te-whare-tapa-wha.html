      <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>
      <h3 class="centertext">
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of wellbeing, based on 4 main pillars of
        wellbeing. The model is symbolised by the 4 walls of the wharenui, and
        the connection to the whenua (the land). Using these, I will form a
        wellbeing plan.

      <h2>Taha Tinana</h2>
      <p>
        Taha Tinana is phyiscal wellbeing. I always make an effort to make
        decisions that are good for my body, particularly being physically
        active. Where I most need to improve is ensuring my sleep is good and
        consistent. I will practice better sleep practices via moderating late
        caffeine, and early sunlight viewing. I will also commit to cooking my
        meals rather than buying food, at least 3 days of the week.
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Hinengaro</h2>
      <p>
        Taha Hinegaro is emotional and mental wellbeing. I believe the best
        practices for me, will be reflection, mindfulness, and sleep. Reflection
        and mindfulness are important to help process thoughts and emotions. I
        will journal at least every two days, and meditate every day. Sleep is
        something I have struggled with for years, and life is much smoother
        with decent sleep. I have started tracking my sleep, and when it's poor,
        looking at what factors might have influenced it.

      <h2>Taha Wairua</h2>
      <p>
        Taha Wairua is spiritual wellbeing. My personal experience of
        spirituality is connection with the world, to other people, and with
        myself. Getting caught up in a busy life, I sometimes forget to have
        appreciation for all those things. I will work on my spiritual wellbeing
        through mindfulness practice, and expressing my gratitude every day.

    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Tana Whānau</h2>
      <p>
        Tana Whānau is family wellbeing. This encompasses not just related
        family, but your community at large. I am blessed to have both loving
        friends and family in my life. My commitment is to spend at least an
        afternoon with my immediate family per week, and to catch up with a
        friend, even if just for lunch, at least once per week.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Whenua</h2>
      <p>
        The other 4 pillars rest upon the Whenua, the land, as their foundation.
        I will strengthen my connection with the natural world by getting out
        for a walk with nature at least twice a week. Mindfulness and meditation
        also brings me an appreciation and connection to the natural world.
