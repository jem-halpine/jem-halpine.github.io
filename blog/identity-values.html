      <h2>About an ethical decision</h2>
      <p>
        I feel very fortunate to have to have a group of good friends who are
        kind, compassionate, and non judgmental. A few years ago, I kept
        another, but less close, group of friends who were less open minded and
        would casually make some pretty toxic remarks. One time at a social
        gathering, an individual from that group came, and they said some pretty
        gross things around some friends and my flatmate. After I heard what
        they said, I was pretty upset and called out the individual. The end
        result, was I cut contact with the friend group. Reflecting on it now,
        I'm glad I made the decision to cut ties. However I'm disappointed it
        took my friends pointing it out, to properly set boundaries and stand up
        for my values.

      <h2>Culture shaping identity</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in New Zealand, I've always sensed there's an unwritten rule
        of being polite above all else. In contrast, the American side of my
        family would be considered “direct” or even “brash” in NZ. It might
        almost be considered rude here, and yet, they are such people. It seems
        both cultures have rubbed off on me, both kindness and honestly are
        values that are core to me. The tricky bit is trying to balance those
        two values.

      <h2>Strengths and weaknesses around learning</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest strengths are social intelligence, fairness, and curiosity.
        Social intelligence and fairness will support me best in group settings,
        whether it's networking, effective collaboration, or even conflict
        resolution. Curiosity will help me engage with topics, and can support
        problem solving and critical thinking, from the desire to explore topics
        deeply.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some limitations I really feel are in how well I can maintain focus, and
        how I find motivation to get tasks completed. But really the biggest
        limitation for me is my self belief, because of those perceived
        limitations.

      <h2>An example of conflict</h2>
      <p>
        At my previous job, I had a fairly “abrasive” colleague. The job
        involved sales and this person was very competitive, in what is usually
        a harmonious teamwork environment. It was at the point where their
        competitiveness was at the expense of good relationships with
        colleagues. It's always my instinct to try to keep the peace, but with
        the headstrong personalities, mediation didn't improve the situation.
        Eventually it wore on me too, so I just focused on my own work, as best
        as I could. In reflection, next time I find a similar situation, I'd
        like to get to work to understand the individuals motivations and
        values. I may learn a different perspective, or how to work a little
        better with them.
