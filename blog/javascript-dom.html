        An explanation of what I've learned about the DOM, JavaScript, and some

      <h2>Explaining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        HTML forms the base and structure of a website, and where you put the
        content of a website. Imagine it like a blank birthday card, with: “Dear
        dad. Happy Birthday!”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        CSS is how the content on your page is styled. Imagine it like choosing
        the color and font of the birthday card.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        JavaScript can make a website interactive, and change content under
        conditions you choose. Think of it like the birthday card playing music
        when you open it, and stopping when you close it.

      <h2>Understanding the DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is how browsers organise the data of a
        website. JavaScript uses the DOM to interact with a website. You can use
        the DOM to update or manipulate the content of a website. Here is an
        example which would change text to be spooky when clicked on:
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow lets you make things happen under conditions of your
        choosing. If I were writing code to tell me whether to shower, depending
        on how stinky I am, it would look like:
      </p>
      <img class="blogIMG" src=/images/stinky.jpeg>
      <p>
        Loops let you repeat steps until a set condition is met. If I wanted to
        write code for steps to get clean while showering, it would look like:
      </p>
      <img class="blogIMG" src=/images/clean.jpeg>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Understanding functions</h2>
      <p>
        A function is a section of code that performs an action or returns a
        value. You can think of it like giving someone a specific instruction.
        Inside a function is written the desired action that you want it to
        perform, then you can ‘call’ a function by giving it some type of input.
        They’re especially useful, as sometimes they can be reused. Here is a
        function which returns a message, plus whatever name is entered:
