      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain and nervous system to change
        in response to experience. Neuroplasticity takes several different
        forms, and can happen in response to many things. It can happen from
        stress or trauma, from learning, or even from injury. May times,
        neuroplasticity happens without your concious intention. But amazingly,
        we can make it happen through concious action.

        The incredable, also possibly surprising thing, is that we can purposly
        self-induce neuroplasticity. There is research to incicate that we can
        support neuroplasticity from:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Learning</strong> (eg. a new skill or language)</p>
      <p><strong>Getting enough sleep</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Mindfulness</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Creative pursuits</strong></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Understanding that we can have direct input into how our brain functions
        is incredibly powerful. For me, knowing that I'm not completely at the
        mercy of how my brain is hardwired, gives me more agency and peace with
        myself. It also helps me to be conscious what activities will help me and
        why, and provides more motivation to do those things that will benefit
        my neuroplasticity. For more insight into neuroplasticity,
