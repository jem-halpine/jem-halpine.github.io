      <h2>Long term goals</h2>
      <p>
        My longterm goal is to become an adept developer, and to become familiar
        with other sectors in tech. I feel there's a lot of satisfaction to
        being a talented developer, but I'm also interested to see if my people
        skills are useful in adjacent areas, like tech sales or recruitment, or
        even project management. Overall, I'm aiming to develop well-rounded,
        and see where I can find the most joy and satisfaction.

      <h2>Strengths and limitations for learning</h2>
      <p>
        I am at my strongest learning when others are relying on me to learn and
        perform. If there's a group project I need to be ready for, you bet I'll
        nail it. I'm the weakest I'm learning and working on my own volition, I
        struggle to find motivation and commit to tasks.

    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Skills to develop</h2>
      <p>
        n my time at Dev Academy, I'm hoping to build confidence and ability
        working by myself. I'm excited to develop tools and strategies to work
        effectively and efficiently, and reaffirm my self belief.

    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>My commitment to managing workloads</h2>
      <p>
        I commit to prioritizing my learning and coursework first and foremost.
        I will communicate often with other learners and facilitators, to build
        the enthusiasm to learn, and then give that enthusiasm back to others.
        When the workload becomes too much, I'll be honestly and forthcoming,
        look for any advice or criticism, and listen to any criticisms seriously
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>My commitment to seeking help</h2>
      <p>
        While remote during foundations, I'll reach out to our lovely community
        via discord. I'm better at explaining an issue in person, so during
        bootcamp, I'll chat to other learners and facilitators when I need help.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Non course commitments</h2>
      <p>
        I am all but free of big responsibilities, my top commitment now is my
        learning. My only obligation is to my tennis team every other Sunday.
