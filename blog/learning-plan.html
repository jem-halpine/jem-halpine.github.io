      <h2>Long term and career goals</h2>
      <p>
        Immediately after bootcamp, my focus will be on networking, and becoming
        super familiar with the tech sector, and the people in it. Longterm, my
        goal is to experiment with the “digital nomad” lifestyle, and see a
        little bit more of the world, ideally while still enjoying my work
        remotely. I believe back end development interests me most, but I’m
        interested first in getting a feel of what all of the Dev process is
        like

      <h2>Strengths, limitations, and challenges during Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest strength coming into bootcamp, I feel is passion and
        enthusiasm. Of course, enthusiasm can only get you so far, but for me,
        being excited about a topic helps me zone in and focus much better. I
        also feel that when I’m engaged in something, my analytic skills and
        problem solving are pretty decent. I feel my biggest limitation may be
        optimal planning and time management. Planning has never been my strong
        suit, and particularly if something is new for me, I can struggle with
        time management habits.

      <h2>Bootcamp Human Skills</h2>
      <p>
        While at Dev Academy, I’d mostly like to learn problem solving and work
        on tools to improve habits. I feel that my work and productivity is
        effective and efficient when I’m in a good rhythm, but the struggle is
        being able to find that rhythm and keep with it.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Bootcamp expectations</h2>
      <p>
        My expectation for the team is that they’ll be willing to help if I
        reach out with and questions or struggles, but also that they keep me
        accountable. Of course, I’m ultimately the only one who is accountable
        for my own learning, but I’d appreciate if the team is able to remind me
        of my commitments, but still offer their support.
      </p>
    </br>
    <p>
      My expectations for myself in bootcamp is work close to my best capacity. The most important thing for me is to know that every day, I put in satisfactory work, that I stuck to my learning plan commitments, and that I don’t come to the end of the day thinking “I barely got anything done today”.

      <h2>Long term goals</h2>
      <p>
        My longterm goal is to become an adept developer, and to become familiar
        with other sectors in tech. I feel there's a lot of satisfaction to
        being a talented developer, but I'm also interested to see if my people
        skills are useful in adjacent areas, like tech sales or recruitment, or
        even project management. Overall, I'm aiming to develop well-rounded,
        and see where I can find the most joy and satisfaction.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Strengths and limitations for learning</h2>
      <p>
        I am at my strongest learning when others are relying on me to learn and
        perform. If there's a group project I need to be ready for, you bet I'll
        nail it. I'm the weakest I'm learning and working on my own volition, I
        struggle to find motivation and commit to tasks.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Skills to develop</h2>
      <p>
        n my time at Dev Academy, I'm hoping to build confidence and ability
        working by myself. I'm excited to develop tools and strategies to work
        effectively and efficiently, and reaffirm my self belief.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>My commitment to managing workloads</h2>
      <p>
        I commit to prioritizing my learning and coursework first and foremost.
        I will communicate often with other learners and facilitators, to build
        the enthusiasm to learn, and then give that enthusiasm back to others.
        When the workload becomes too much, I'll be honestly and forthcoming,
        look for any advice or criticism, and listen to any criticisms seriously
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>My commitment to seeking help</h2>
      <p>
        While remote during foundations, I'll reach out to our lovely community
        via discord. I'm better at explaining an issue in person, so during
        bootcamp, I'll chat to other learners and facilitators when I need help.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentwrap">
      <h2>Non course commitments</h2>
      <p>
        I am all but free of big responsibilities, my top commitment now is my
        learning. My only obligation is to my tennis team every other Sunday.
