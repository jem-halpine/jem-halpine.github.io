      <h2>Human skills learning and the ego</h2>
      <p>
        In these 5 weeks of learning with Dev Academy foundation, really
        everything was completely new for me. It was a new style of learning, a
        new routine, and all the content I was learning was initially completely
        foreign. There was a lot of learning about myself too. I was out of my
        comfort zone of being able to engage with people in person, and my ego
        convinced me I wasn't up to the task of learning self directed. A big
        thing I learned is that often a little bit goes a long way. Just a few
        minutes a day of self reflection, mindfulness, or journaling makes a
        huge difference for building healthy habits. Even if it doesn't feel
        like a big step, it takes you a long long way.

      <h2>Values, Empathy, and Self Awareness in programming</h2>
      <p>
        Early on we took some time to examine ourselves and our values. I
        understood that it was important to do, but not so much initially why in
        particular for programming. In a professional setting, programming
        successfully will often be a collaborative effort. Simply having the
        technical capacity to program well, will not be enough to find success
        as a programmer. If people enjoy, and are enthusiastic to work with you
        you,they'll also certainly work better. Self awareness helps you
        identify your strengths and weaknesses, and even if you're coding alone
        on a personal project, having empathy and understanding your values
        helps you realise your biases helps you consider how others might
        interact with what you're working on.

      <h2>Surprises and challenges in Human Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Something challenging for me while learning human skills was the self
        examination. Although I am pretty self aware, prodding too deep into
        myself was pretty uncomfortable at times. Trying to clearly articulate
        and blog my thoughts was tough for me at times too. I was surprised at
        some of the problem solving tools. During my research, it seemed that
        pretty much everyone agreed on some very specific tools and methods to
        problem solve. I'm still working on using them consistently, but so far
        they were very helpful.

      <h2>The role of Human Skills at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        I understood coming into Dev Academy that not all the learning material
        would be technical, but no specifically what the other material would
        cover. I was pleased to realise that the human skills we've covered are
        all specific, relevant to programmers, and backed by research.p It makes
        intuitive sense that employers will be looking for well rounded
        candidates that will fit in well with their workplace culture and team.
        I'm not yet so familiar with the industry, but the impression I get is
        that there are a disproportionate number of developers who work well
        with code, but just not as well with people. I'm honestly grateful to
        know that we'll be given the opportunity to become well rounded
        developers.
