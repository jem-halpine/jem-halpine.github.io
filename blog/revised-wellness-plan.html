      <h2>My stress profile</h2>
      <p>
        What it looks like: I become detached, reserved, and much less
        talkative. What I need: I need a little time to myself (30 minutes) to
        help my collect my thoughts and get some composure. Then I appreciate
        someone checking in on me, and some gentle encouragement.
      </p>

      <h2>Taha Tirana</h2>
      <p>
        I still have a strong interest in looking after my body. Each aspect of
        physical health affects the others, namely sleep, diet, and regular
        exercise. While I now recognise that sometimes, my amount of sleep will
        suffer occasionally during the chaos of bootcamp, I will ensure I never
        go two nights in a row without satisfactory sleep, and make sure I
        prioritise ideal sleep at least 5 nights a week. I recognise too, that I
        may not be able to enjoy as much exercise as I would usually like, I
        will still ensure I take time, at least 3 days a week, to enjoy a walk
        or short run. Some of my down time outside of coding will also be used
        for exercise I enjoy, like a tennis match or a visit to the gym. I will
        continue to cook at least one healthy meal a day for myself and my
        family, since it brings me joy and makes me feel great.

      <h2>Taha Hinengaro</h2>
      <p>
        I have found new focus and interest for mental health. Bootcamp has
        helped me become acutely more aware and understanding of my mental
        health. I still keep my focuses on sleep and mindfulness which have both
        been essential, but I now have a keener eye for my stress profile, and
        for my self talk and self image. I will ask myself daily, how am I
        feeling? I will take note of my self talk through the days, in
        particular during the tough days. If I’m struggling, I will be honest
        but kind with myself.,and reach out rather than braving it alone.

      <h2>Taha Wairua</h2>
      <p>
        I will continue to appreciate the world around me, and the fortunate
        place I have on this wonderful world. I feel truly blessed to be a part
        of life.

      <h2>Whenua</h2>
      <p>
        I am in a lucky position to live amongst some truly beautiful natural
        landscape. I am excited to spend more time with nature, when I am not
        required to be at a keyboard. Even when I am, I am lucky to get to look
        over the land and appreciate where I am, here and now.

      <h2>Tana Whānau</h2>
      <p>
        Going forward, I am making plans to soon move country, so I will need to
        adjust how I appreciate my family and friends, and spend time with them.
        Before my departure, I will continue to cherish time spent with them,
        and let them know that even if I get caught up with my learning, I still
        value and love them. Between the end of bootcamp, and my move however,
        they will be my top priority, and I’m excited to reconnect with all of
        them. After my move, I will regularly check in with my Pōneke whānau,
        while I find a new community of new and old friends in Sydney.
