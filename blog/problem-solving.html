      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <h3 class="centertext">
        Often when faced with challenges and difficulties, it's easy to become
        frustrated. I would usually default to just staring at the problem with
        frustration, and eventually just running away from the problem, or
        putting it off for later. But the beauty of challenges is that is it
        when you can find tremendous growth. When faced with difficulties,
        applying problem solving tools strengthens the ability to to overcome
        any future problem in a methodical way, not just ones similar to the
        current problem. It also builds confidence a resilience to frustration.

      <h2>Stuck on a simple problem</h2>
      <p>
        During the recent "JavaScript Kata", a task had us write some code to
        capitalize a phrase. The problem certainly feels more simple now than it
        did at the time. I understood what steps needed to happen in order for
        it to work, but I just wasn't getting it working. The key for solving
        this for me was to clearly understand what happens each step. Psuedocode
        was useful, as it breaks it down into steps. I finally overcame it by
        using pen and paper to keep track of where it method left me, and
        testing each method in the code individually.

      <h2>An elegant solve</h2>
      <p>
        I had a smoother solve to a problem which had us remove a word from a
        phrase. After struggling so much earlier, I wrote psseudocode, and
        carefully mapped out on paper what steps needed to happen. I was more
        methodical, checking each method individually as I wrote them, and
        googling to make sure I was using the correct syntax.

      <h2>Asking for help</h2>
      <p>
        Reflecting on my challenges during the Kata, I was a little too
        reluctant to ask for help. I was feeling a bit conscious about being
        behind, so my ego got in the way. I did talk things through with a
        fellow student, and it really helped me though! In reflection, I realise
        that everyone needs a little help sometimes, I'm more confident to ask
        for help sooner.
