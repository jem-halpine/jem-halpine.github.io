      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence, or Emotional Quotient (EQ) is one's ability to
        recognise, evaluate, and manage their emotions. EQ also concerns one's
        ability to recognise and understand other's emotions.

      <h2>Why Emotional Intelligence is useful</h2>
      <p>
        The impact of EQ can be seen every day of your life. Having a strong EQ
        is arguably essential for long-term wellbeing. Improving EQ, while
        empowering you with the ability to regulate your emotions, will also
        help you to make better decisions, with more clarity and agency. Of
        course, everything social or interpersonal is effected by EQ, helping
        you to foster productive, healthy, and fulfilling relationships.

      <h2>Strengthening Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <p>Some ways to improve EQ include:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Practicing mindfulness </strong>Mindfulness involves focusing
        fully on the present moment. For many, consistent mindfulness practice
        helps with emotional awareness and regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Self reflection </strong>Spending time observing and reflecting
        on your thoughts and feels can bring greater self awareness. Journaling
        is a great way to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Practicing Empathy </strong>Practice imagining yourself in
        someone else's position. Make an effort to consider any different
        feelings or perspectives they might have.
